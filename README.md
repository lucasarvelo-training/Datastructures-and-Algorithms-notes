## About this repo

This repo consists of my notes of algorithms and datastructures classes taught in University of Cyprus.

The repo contains most, if not all content as taught in the classes along with accompanied code. For educational purposes, the code is written in python and/or C. Special cases and optimisations that are either not possible in python or make little sense to implement in Python, will be implemented C. It's expected that the reader is familiar with programming, and Object Oriented Programming and pointers.

Example of this, is a double link linked list with only one (1) field for neighbouring elements.

## Content

0. [Lecture 0 - What are algorithms and their importance.](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-0.md)
1. [Lecture 1 - Big-O notation](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-1.md)
2. [Lecture 2 - Runtime analysis Examples](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-2.md)
3. [Lecture 3 - Abstract datatypes](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-3.md)

**Note :** The content and lectures above, are only those I have completed thus far. For a complete list of the content I am working on, checkout the [roadmap](#roadmap).

## Note style

### Code

All code will be marked \`\`\`Language ...code... \`\`\` when the lecture is read in raw format. When viewed through Github and Pandoc, it will be color coded based on the language as such:

* Python
    ```Python
        class foo:
            def __init__(self):
                print("bar")
    ```
  * All Python code is written with Python 3.6
* C
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void){
        char * foo = "bar";
        printf("%s",foo);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
  * All C code is Compiled with ```gcc 7.2.0``` and flags ```-Wall -pedantic``` on ```Manjaro Linux```.

### Roadmap

- [x] Write Lectures 0 - 3:

* [Lecture 0 - What are algorithms and their importance.](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-0.md)
* [Lecture 1 - Big-O notation](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-1.md)
* [Lecture 2 - Runtime analysis Examples](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-2.md)
* [Lecture 3 - Abstract datatypes](./Lectures/Compiled/Lecture-3.md)

- [x] Rewrite Readme.md
- [x] Move [Raw](./Lectures/Raw) and [Compiled](./Lectures/Compiled) lectures to their own folders.
- [ ] Fix some grammar/spelling mistakes as well as some formula visibility issues in Lectures 0-3.
